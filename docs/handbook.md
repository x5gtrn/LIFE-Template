# Handbook

## Principle
- LIFE is private: high-context, raw notes
- TIL is public: low-context, reusable learnings

## Core tools
- GitHub Issues: capture tasks, ideas, decisions
- GitHub Projects (v2): manage workflow (board/table/roadmap)
- Markdown files: journal, projects, logs
- Subtree: import TIL for review/search
- GitHub Actions: daily sync + index/digests auto-commit

## Daily (5 minutes)
1. Check Project "Today" view
2. Close or move Done issues
3. Write a single line journal OR 1 small TIL (either is fine)

## Weekly (30–60 minutes)
- Run weekly review checklist (`docs/weekly-review.md`)
- Check weekly digest in `docs/til-weekly/`
- Decide 1–3 priorities for next week

## Monthly (60–90 minutes)
- Update roadmaps
- Review budget
- Review learning direction
- Archive finished areas

## Naming conventions
### Journal
`journal/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Decisions (optional)
Store as Markdown using template:
`logs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

### Plans
- `projects/career/roadmap.md`
- `projects/health/routines.md`
- `projects/finance/budget.md`
- `projects/music/next-release.md`
