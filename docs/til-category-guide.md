# TIL Category Guide (Suggested)

This is a suggested category structure for your **public** `til` repository.
Pick what you actually use. Start small and grow.

## Personal ops (optional, keep it public-safe)
- `writing/` (how you write, templates, not private logs)
- `learning/` (study techniques, not personal details)

## Music (public-safe only)
- `music-production/`
  - ableton/
  - mixing/
  - mastering/
  - sound-design/
- `dj/`
  - set-building/
  - transitions/
  - traktor/

## Naming rules (recommended)
- Prefer **descriptive filenames**:
  - `s3-presigned-url-expiration.md`
  - `spring-graphql-multipart-upload.md`
- In the first lines, add quick metadata:
  - What / Why / How / Example / References

## How to expand safely
- If you are unsure whether something is private, put it in LIFE (private) first.
- When publishing to TIL, rewrite as generalized learning (no names, no money, no locations).
